    Hi! I'm Haixiang Tang, an undergraduate student at <a href="https://illinois.edu/"> University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</a> I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Statistics. <br><br>
    
    My academic interests lie at nlp, data mining and agentic ai. I am always eager to apply theoretical principles to solve practical problems. I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://yuzhimanhua.github.io/"> Prof. Yu Zhang </a> from the Texas A&M University and <a href="http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/"> Prof. Linfeng Zhang </a> from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.<br><br>

    In my spare time, I like listening to music(Jazz&classic), watching anime, and playing ACG-related games. I'm deeply interested in otaku culture. If you find similar interests with me, feel free to contact!
